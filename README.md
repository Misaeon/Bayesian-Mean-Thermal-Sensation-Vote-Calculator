# BI4TSV: Bayesian Mean Thermal Sensation Vote Calculator
The software was developed in conjunction with a research paper entitled "**A novel approach to calculate the mean thermal sensation vote for primary and secondary schools using Bayesian inference**" published in the Journal of Building Engineering.

This novel method calculates the **Mean Thermal Sensation Vote (MTSV)** based on **Bayesian inference**, which takes into account the **uncertainty** associated with the **Thermal Sensation Votes (TSV)** collected in field surveys in educational buildings. The software is capable of calculating **PMV index**, **observed MTSV**, and Bayesian inference- **enhanced MTSV** based on data of measured indoor thermal parameters and collected TSV.
